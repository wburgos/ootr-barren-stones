# ootr-barren-stones
Generates a plando file based on S6 settings with stone dungeons automatically pre-completed (barren).

Use here: https://wburgos.github.io/ootr-barren-stones/

Note: The rewards are randomized normally like they would with a regular S6 seed generation. The script then checks which dungeons got a stone and marks them as pre-completed. The randomization happens on every reload of the page linked above.

If you get a stone on Links Pocket reward then you'll only have 2 pre-completed dungeons instead of 3 (wherever the other 2 stones are).
