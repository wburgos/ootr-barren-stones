# ootr-barren-stones
Generate a plando file based on S6 settings with stone dungeons automatically pre-completed (barren).

Use here: https://wburgos.github.io/ootr-barren-stones/

Note: The rewards are randomized normally like they would with a regular S6 seed generation. The script then checks which dungeon got a stone and marks it as pre-completed.
