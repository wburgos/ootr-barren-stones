# ootr-barren-stones
Generates a plando file based on S6 settings with stone dungeons automatically pre-completed (barren).

Use here: https://wburgos.github.io/ootr-barren-stones/

Note: The rewards (stones/medallions) are first placed randomly by the script in the usual rewards locations (similar to what S6 settings do). It then checks which dungeons got a stone and marks them as pre-completed. The randomization happens on every (re)load of the page linked above.
